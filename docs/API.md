# Fizzy API

Fizzy has an API that allows you to integrate your application with it or to create
a bot to perform various actions for you.

## Authentication

To use the API you'll need an access token. To get one, go to your profile, then,
in the API section, click on "Personal access tokens" and then click on
"Generate new access token".

Give it a description and pick what kind of permission you want the access token to have:
- `Read`: allows reading data from your account
- `Read + Write`: allows reading and writing data to your account on your behalf

Then click on "Generate access token".

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> __An access token is like a password, keep it secret and do not share it with anyone.__
> Any person or application that has your access token can perform actions on your behalf.

To authenticate a request using your access token, include it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer put-your-access-token-here" -H "Accept: application/json" https://app.fizzy.do/my/identity
```

## Caching

Most endpoints return [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag) and [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control) headers. You can use these to avoid re-downloading unchanged data.

### Using ETags

When you make a request, the response includes an `ETag` header:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "abc123"
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
```

On subsequent requests, include the ETag value in the `If-None-Match` header:

```
GET /1234567/cards/42.json
If-None-Match: "abc123"
```

If the resource hasn't changed, you'll receive a `304 Not Modified` response with no body, saving bandwidth and processing time:

```
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
ETag: "abc123"
```

If the resource has changed, you'll receive the full response with a new ETag.

__Example in Ruby:__

```ruby
# Store the ETag from the response
etag = response.headers["ETag"]

# On next request, send it back
headers = { "If-None-Match" => etag }
response = client.get("/1234567/cards/42.json", headers: headers)

if response.status == 304
  # Nothing to do, the card hasn't changed
else
  # The card has changed, process the new data
end
```

## Error Responses

When a request fails, the API response will communicate the source of the problem through the HTTP status code.

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `400 Bad Request` | The request was malformed or missing required parameters |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Authentication failed or access token is invalid |
| `403 Forbidden` | You don't have permission to perform this action |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource doesn't exist or you don't have access to it |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Validation failed (see error response format above) |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | An unexpected error occurred on the server |

If a request contains invalid data for fields, such as entering a string into a number field, in most cases the API will respond with a `500 Internal Server Error`. Clients are expected to perform some validation on their end before making a request.

Validation error will produce a `422 Unprocessable Entity` which will sometimes be accompanied by details about the validation errors:

```json
{
  "avatar": ["must be a JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP image"]
}
```

## Pagination

All endpoints that return a list of items are paginated. The page size can vary from endpoint to endpoint,
and we use a dynamic page size where initial pages return fewer results than later pages.

If there are more results to fetch, the response will include a `Link` header with a `rel="next"` link to the next page of results:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer put-your-access-token-here" -H "Accept: application/json" -v http://fizzy.localhost:3006/686465299/cards
# ...
< link: <http://fizzy.localhost:3006/686465299/cards?page=2>; rel="next"
# ...
```

## File Uploads

Some endpoints accept file uploads. To upload a file, send a `multipart/form-data` request instead of JSON.
You can combine file uploads with other parameters in the same request.

__Example using curl:__

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer put-your-access-token-here" \
  -F "user[name]=David H. Hansson" \
  -F "user[avatar]=@/path/to/avatar.jpg" \
  http://fizzy.localhost:3006/686465299/users/03f5v9zjw7pz8717a4no1h8a7
```

## Rich Text Fields

Some fields accept rich text content. These fields accept HTML input, which will be sanitized to remove unsafe tags and attributes.

```json
{
  "card": {
    "title": "My card",
    "description": "<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> and this is <em>italic</em>.</p><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>"
  }
}
```

### Attaching files to rich text

To attach files (images, documents) to rich text fields, use ActionText's direct upload flow:

#### 1. Create a direct upload

First, request a direct upload URL by sending file metadata:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer put-your-access-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "blob": {
      "filename": "screenshot.png",
      "byte_size": 12345,
      "checksum": "GQ5SqLsM7ylnji0Wgd9wNA==",
      "content_type": "image/png"
    }
  }' \
  https://app.fizzy.do/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads
```

The `checksum` is a Base64-encoded MD5 hash of the file content.

__Response:__

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "key": "abc123def456",
  "filename": "screenshot.png",
  "content_type": "image/png",
  "byte_size": 12345,
  "checksum": "GQ5SqLsM7ylnji0Wgd9wNA==",
  "direct_upload": {
    "url": "https://storage.example.com/...",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "image/png",
      "Content-MD5": "GQ5SqLsM7ylnji0Wgd9wNA=="
    }
  },
  "signed_id": "eyJfcmFpbHMi..."
}
```

#### 2. Upload the file

Upload the file directly to the provided URL with the specified headers:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
  -H "Content-MD5: GQ5SqLsM7ylnji0Wgd9wNA==" \
  --data-binary @screenshot.png \
  "https://storage.example.com/..."
```

#### 3. Reference the file in rich text

Use the `signed_id` from step 1 to embed the file in your rich text using an `<action-text-attachment>` tag:

```json
{
  "card": {
    "title": "Card with image",
    "description": "<p>Here's a screenshot:</p><action-text-attachment sgid=\"eyJfcmFpbHMi...\"></action-text-attachment>"
  }
}
```

The `sgid` attribute should contain the `signed_id` returned from the direct upload response.

## Identity

An Identity represents a person using Fizzy, their email address and their users in different accounts.

### `GET /my/identity`

Returns a list of accounts, including the User, the Identity has access to

```json
{
  "accounts": [
